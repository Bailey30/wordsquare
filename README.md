# Word Square

After cloning the repository, run the program from in the command line from the directory it is in with the command:

```node index.js <size> <input-string>```

where `<size>` is the height and width of the square to be created and `<input-string>` is a valid set of characters to populate the square.

For example:

`node index.js 4 eeeeddoonnnsssrv` 

Should ideally produce:

```
rose 
oven 
send 
ends
```
